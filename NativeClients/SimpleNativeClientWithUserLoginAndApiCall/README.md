# Native Client Sample
This sample shows how to use a native client (a command line application) to log in an user, request an access token and call an API with this token.

### Requirements

The [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) is required to build the program.

First, you will need to start the [Sample API project](../../SampleAPI/README.md) in a separate terminal. Then, you can run this application, either with or without a request for a child organization number. 

#### To run the sample:
```
dotnet run
```
